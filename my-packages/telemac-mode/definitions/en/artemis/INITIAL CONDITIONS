HELP = Enables to define the initial conditions on water depths.
Allowable values are :
- ZERO ELEVATION : fixes the free surface level to 0.
Water depths are then equal to the difference between
free surface level and bottom level.
- CONSTANT ELEVATION : fixes the free surface level to the value
specified by the key-word INITIAL WATER LEVEL. Water
level are then computed as before.
- ZERO DEPTH : initializes the water depths to 0.
- CONSTANT DEPTH : initializes the water depths to the value
specified by the key-word INITIAL DEPTH.
- SPECIAL : initial conditions on water depths are to be
precised in the sub-routine CONDIH.

CHOICE = '"ZERO ELEVATION"';
'"CONSTANT ELEVATION"';
'"ZERO DEPTH"';
'"CONSTANT DEPTH "';
'"SPECIAL"'

DEFAULT = ZERO ELEVATION
