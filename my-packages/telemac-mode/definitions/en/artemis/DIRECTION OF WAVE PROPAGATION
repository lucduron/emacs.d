HELP = Fixes the direction towards the incident waves at boundaries go to.
It is counted in degress and positively in the trigonometric sense
relatively to the x axis.
This value is prescribed as a constant value along all the wave
incident type boundaries. If one wants to specify a non uniform value,
the user has to specify the value TETAB in the sub-routine BORH.

DEFAULT = 0.0
