HELP = Used with the option FRICTION = YES.
Yes, enables the user to impose a friction factor, by a key-word
for a constant value (see real of index 29) or by programming in
the FWSPEC sub-routine for non-uniform value.
If Not, ARTEMIS automatically computes the friction factor assuming
that the bottom is sandy and uses the characteristics of sediment
and of motion.

DEFAULT = NON
