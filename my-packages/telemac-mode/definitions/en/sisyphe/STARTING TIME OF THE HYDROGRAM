HELP = this key word specifies the time when SISYPHE computation
begins except when a computation is continued (the initial time
is then read on the "previous sendimentological file".
For an unsteady case, it moreover specifies the time which
corresponds to the 1st record to be read in the "previous
computation file"(the file which contains the hydrodynamic
data).

DEFAULT = -1000.
