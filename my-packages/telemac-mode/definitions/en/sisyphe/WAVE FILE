HELP = Name of a file containing the results a previous
TOMAWAC computation  made on the same mesh. The wave data (wave height,
wave period, wave angle ) will
be given by the last record of the file.
The user has to verify that both informations (wave and current data)
are consistent.
Remark :The wave data can also be specified in
the hydrodynamic file. the user has also
the possibility to give the values
of the wave data in the subroutine CONDIM.
This is recommended for non-steady flow simulation.

DEFAULT = no value
