HELP = Determines whether the computation under way is an independent
result or is following an earlier result.
NO: It is the first run for this computation and a whole set of
initial conditions should be defined.
YES: It follows a former computation:
the initial conditions consist in the last time step of the
PREVIOUS COMPUTATION FILE
in the steering file used for submitting the computation.
All the data from the steering file may be defined once again, which
provides an opportunity to change, for example, the time step.
It is also possible to define new boundary conditions.

DEFAULT = NO
