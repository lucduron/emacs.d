HELP = Makes it possible to select the solver used for solving the
bottom evolution equation (Used only if the key-word MASS LUMPING
is equal to false). All the currently available methods are
variations of the Conjugate Gradient method. They are as follows:
1: conjugate gradient
2: conjugate residual
3: conjugate gradient on a normal equation
4: minimum error
5: conjugate gradient squared (not implemented)
6: conjugate gradient squared stabilised (cgstab)
7: gmres (see option for solver)

CHOICE = 3
'1="conjugate gradient"';
'2="conjugate residual"';
'4="minimum error"';
'6="cgstab"';
'7="gmres"

DEFAULT = 3
