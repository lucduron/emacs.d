HELP = Ratio for the computation of skin friction.
skin roughness = ratio * mean diameter
(for the mixture of sand, the mean diameter used is a value per node which
is computed thanks to the fraction and the mean diameter of each sediment
for each node of the mesh)
if KSPRATIO =0 : use skin friction prediction from Van Rijn (2007)
for currents and the Wiberg and Harris method for waves

DEFAULT = 3.0
