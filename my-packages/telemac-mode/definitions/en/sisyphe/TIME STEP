HELP = Specifies the time step in seconds in steady case.
For an unsteady case, this time step is fixed by the graphic
printout period of the previous computation file, except if
no name is given for the 'HYDRODYNAMIC FILE' in
the steering file.
Remark : If the keyword 'VARIABLE TIME STEP' is set equal
to yes, the time step required for a correct resolution is
computed in the code and sub-iterations are performed

DEFAULT = 1.
