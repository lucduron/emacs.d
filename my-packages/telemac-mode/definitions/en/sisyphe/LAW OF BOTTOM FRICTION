HELP = Selects the type of formulation used for the bottom friction.
To know the possible laws see CHOIX1 above. See FRICTION COEFFICIENT. Beware: in the case
of internal coupling with Telemac, the friction coefficient is selected in the Telemac steering
file, except when BED ROUGHNESS PREDICTION is set to YES
