HELP = Specifies the moment when the SISYPHE extrapolation current
filed is no more valid. This value set the maximum ratio between
evolutions and the water depth.
Generally, it is considered that an evolution lower than 0,1 time the
water depth does not perceptibly modify the current field distribution.

DEFAULT = 1.
