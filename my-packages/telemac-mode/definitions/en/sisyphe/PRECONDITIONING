HELP = Choice of the preconditioning in the resolution of the linear
system that the convergence is speeded up when it is being solved (Used
only if the key-word MASS LUMPING  is equal to false).
0: no preconditioning
2: diagonal preconditioning
3: diagonal preconditioning with the condensed matrix
7: Crout's preconditioning per element (not implemented).
Some operations (either 2 or 3 diagonal preconditioning) can be
performed concurrently with the others.
Only prime numbers are therefore kept to denote the preconditioning
operations. When several of them are to be performed concurrently,
the product of relevant options shall be made.

CHOICE = 2
'3="diagonal condensee"'; '7="crout"';
'14="diagonal and crout"'; '21="diagonal condensed  and crout"

DEFAULT = 2
