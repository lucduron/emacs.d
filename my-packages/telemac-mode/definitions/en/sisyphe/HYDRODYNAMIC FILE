HELP = Name of a file containing the results a previous
computation  made on the same mesh. The hydrodynamic will
be given by the last record of the file if the case is
steady or, if the case is unsteady, by the time steps
describing the tide or flood.
Remark :If the bed-load transport under the combined
action of currents and wave is modelled (keyword
BED-LOAD TRANSPORT FORMULA set equal to 4), this file
must contain not only the hydrodynamic data
(water height, velocities) but also the wave data
(wave height, wave period).However, the user has also
the possibility to give the values
of the wave data in the subroutine CONDIM.

DEFAULT = no value
