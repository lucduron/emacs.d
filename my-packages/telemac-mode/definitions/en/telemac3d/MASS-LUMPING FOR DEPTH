HELP = TELEMAC offers the posibility to perform mass-lumping
on H or U.
This gathers all or part (given the value of the coefficient)
of the AM1(H) or AM2(Ut) and AM3(V) matrices on their
diagonal.
This technique can speed-up the code a lot and also render it
more stable.
Yet, the solutions are smoothened.
This parameter sets the mass-lumping amount done for H.
Not recommended for use.
