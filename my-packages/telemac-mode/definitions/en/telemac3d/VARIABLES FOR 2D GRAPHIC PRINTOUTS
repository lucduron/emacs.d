HELP = Names of variables that may be written in the
2D result file.
Every variable is represented by a group of letters with
any separator between them , ; or blank
possibilities are the following:
U="depth averaged velocity along x axis (m/s)"
V="depth averaged velocity along y axis (m/s)"
C="celerity (m/s)"
H="water depth (m)"
S="free surface elevation (m)"
B="bottom elevation (m)"
F="Froude number (m)"
Q="scalar discharge (m2/s)"
I="discharge along x (m2/s)"
J="discharge along y (m2/s)"
M="norm of velocity (m/s)"
X="wind along x axis (m/s)"
Y="wind along y axis (m/s)"
P="atmospheric pressure (Pa)"
W="friction coefficient"
RB="non erodible bottom elevation (m)"
FD="thickness of the fresh deposits (m)"
EF="erosion rate (kg/m3/s)"
DP="probability of deposition"
PRIVE1="work array PRIVE 1"
PRIVE2="work array PRIVE 2"
PRIVE3="work array PRIVE 3"
PRIVE4="work array PRIVE 4"
US="friction velocity (m/s)"

elevation during the computation (m)"
