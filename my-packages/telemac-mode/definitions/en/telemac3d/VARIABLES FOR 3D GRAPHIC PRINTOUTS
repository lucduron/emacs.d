- W   : velocity along z (m/s),
- Z   : elevation z (m),
- TAx : concentration of tracers,
- NUX : viscosity for U and V along x (m2/s),
- NUY : viscosity for U and V along y (m2/s),
- NUZ : viscosity for U and V along z (m2/s),
- NAX : viscosity for tracers along x (m2/s),
- NAY : viscosity for tracers along y (m2/s),
- NAZ : viscosity for tracers along z (m2/s),
- RI  : Richardson number for mixing length model,
- K   : turbulent kinetic energy for k-epsilon model (J/kg),
- EPS : dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (W/kg),
- DP  : dynamic pressure (multiplied by DT/RHO),
- PH  : hydrostatic pressure (in Pascals),
- RHO : relative density,
- P1  : private variable 1,
- P2  : private variable 2,
- P3  : private variable 3,
- P4  : private variable 4
