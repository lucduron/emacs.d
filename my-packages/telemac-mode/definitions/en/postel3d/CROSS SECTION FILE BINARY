HELP = Binary file type used for writing the cross section files.
This type depends on the machine on which the file was generated.
The possible values are as follows:
I3E, for a file on an HP (from a CRAY)
STD, binary type of the machine on which the user is working.
In that case, normal READ and WRITE commands are used

CHOICE = STD';
'I3E

DEFAULT = STD
