HELP = 'The bathymetric data at the mesh nodes are interpolated. At each mesh
node, the plane is cut into 4 quadrants in each of which, among the
points recorded at the digitizing tablet, the closest one to the node
being considered is searched for.
This node is thenn given a depth corresponding to the mean depth at
each of the 4 points previously found, these depths being weighted
by the distance to the node.
When searching for the points in the quadrants, however, one shall
make sure the boundaries aare not overstepped in order to prevent
aberrations from being introduced into the bathymetric data.
The keyword can then be used for specifying the minimum distance to
the boundaries below which the recorded points should be ignored.'
