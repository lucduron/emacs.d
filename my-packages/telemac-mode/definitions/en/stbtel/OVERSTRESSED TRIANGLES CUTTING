HELP = 'An overstressed triangle is one whose three nodes are located along a
boundary of the computational domain. The occurrence of such triangles
may bring about instabilities in the computations made by TELEMAC 2D.
Such problems can be prevented by this option, through the creation of
a node at the geometric centres of the overstressed triangles.'

DEFAULT = NO
