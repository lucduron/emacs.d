HELP = Selection of the characteristic frequency of the wave spectrum
1 : Frequency Fmoy
2 : Frequency F01 (defined by the moments of order 0 and 1 of the spectrum)
3 : Frequency F02 (defined by the moments of order 0 and 2 of the spectrum)
4 : Frequency Fpic (sampling frequency corresponding to the max)
5 : Frequency Fread ordre 5 (peak frequency, 5th order Read method)
6 : Frequency Fread ordre 8 (peak frequency, 8th order Read method)
