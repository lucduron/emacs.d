HELP = Selection of the modelling type of the non-linear transfert
source term. If its value is 0, the non-linear transfers are ignored;
if its value is 1, they are integrated in accordance with the formula
of WAM cycle 4 (DIA method), if its value is 2, the MDIA
(Multiple DIA) method is used to calculate the non linear transfer
term, if its value is 3, the non linear transfer term is calculated
with the exact GQM method.
