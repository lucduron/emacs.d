HELP = Type of the binary used for writing the puntual results file.
That type depends on the machine in which the file was generated. The
possible values are as follows :
- IBM; for a file created in an IBM machine;
- I3E; for a file created in a HP machine;
- STD; normal READ and WRITE instructions are then generated.
