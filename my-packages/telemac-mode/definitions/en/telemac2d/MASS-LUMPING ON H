HELP = TELEMAC provides an opportunity to carry out mass-lumping
either on C,H or on the velocity.
This is equivalent to bringing the matrices AM1 (h) or AM2 (U) and
AM3 (V) wholly or partly, back onto their diagonal.
Thanks to that technique, the code can be speeded up to a quite
significant extent and it can also be made much more stable. The
resulting solutions, however, become artificially smoothed.
This parameter sets the extent of mass-lumping that is performed on h.

DEFAULT = 0.
