HELP = Names of variables the user wants to write into the results
file. Each variable is represented by a letter. The separators can be
freely selected.
The available capabilities are as follows:
U     :   velocity along x axis (m/s),
V     :   velocity along y axis (m/s),
C     :   wave celerity (m/s),
H     :   water depth (m),
S     :   free surface elevation (m),
B     :   bottom elevation (m),
F     :   Froude number,
Q     :   scalar flowrate of fluid (m2/s),
T     :   tracer
K     :   turbulent kinetic energy in k-epsilon model (J/kg),
E     :   dissipation of turbulent energy (W/kg),
D     :   turbulent viscosity of k-epsilon model (m2/s),
I     :   flowrate along x axis (m2/s),
J     :   flowrate along y axis (m2/s),
M     :   scalar velocity (m/s),
X     :   wind along x axis (m/s)
Y     :   wind along y axis (m/s),
P     :   air pressure (Pa),
W     :   friction coefficient ,
A     :   drift along x,
G     :   drift along y,
L     :   nombre de courant.
four other variables are also made available to the user who may use
them for writing into the file the results of variables he creates
himself. These user-specific variables should be computed in the
subroutine PRERES and their desired name should be written
into the subroutine NOMVAR.
These seven variables are as follows:
-N, O, R, Z which correspond to arrays PRIVE(1,1) up to PRIVE(1,
Unlike the preceding variables, they are preserved throughout the
program, so that they can be used again.
In the latter case, do not forget to provide the array PRIVE with
sufficiently large dimensions (in FORTRAN file).
With this key-word, one can limit the size of the RESULTS FILE.
It should be kept in mind, however, that if a computation has to be
continued, the RESULTS FILE should contain the appropriate information
for running the code,i.e.:
- velocities U and V,
- water depths H,
- bottom elevations B.
TELEMAC, however, can compute some of these variables from others
for example, it will compute H from S and B.
