HELP = The current alternatives are as follows: constant viscosity (1)
elder's model (2) or k-epsilon model (3).
NOTE: when option 1 is chosen, it should be kept in mind that the
value of the keyword VELOCITY DIFFUSIVITY has to be ajusted.
When option 2 is chosen, the two values of key-word :
NON-DIMENSIONAL DISPERSION COEFFICIENTS are used
When option 3 is chosen, this parameter should recover its true
physical value, since it is used as such in the turbulence model.
