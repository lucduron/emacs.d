HELP = Makes it possible to define the initial conditions with
the water depth.
The possible values are as follows:
- ZERO ELEVATION-. Initializes the free surface elevation to 0.
The initial water depths are then found by computing the difference
between the free surface and the bottom.
- CONSTANT ELEVATION-. Initializes the water elevation to the value
given by the keyword -INITIAL ELEVATION-. The initial water depths
are computed as in the previous case.
- ZERO DEPTH-. Initializes the water depths to 0.
- CONSTANT DEPTH-. Initializes the water depths to the value given
by the key-word -INITIAL DEPTH-.
- SPECIAL-. The initial conditions with the water depth should be
stated in the CONDIN subroutine.
- TPXO SATELITE ALTIMETRY. The initial conditions on the free surface and
velocities are established from the TPXO satellite program data, the harmonic
constituents of which are stored in the TIDE DATA BASE file.

CHOICE = "ZERO ELEVATION"'; '"CONSTANT ELEVATION"';
'"ZERO DEPTH"'; '"CONSTANT DEPTH"'; '"SPECIAL"' ;
'"TPXO SATELLITE ALTIMETRY"

DEFAULT = ZERO ELEVATION
