HELP = Initial guess for the solver in the propagation step.
Makes it possible to modify the initial value of U, upon each
iteration in the propagation step, by using the ultimate values this
variable had in the earlier time steps. Thus, the convergence can be
speeded up when the system is being solved. 3 options are available:
0 : U = 0
1 : U = U(n)
2 : U = 2 U(n)- U(n-1) (extrapolation)

CHOICE = '0

DEFAULT = 1
