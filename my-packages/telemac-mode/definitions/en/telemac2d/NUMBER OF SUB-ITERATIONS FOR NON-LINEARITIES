HELP = Used for updating, within one time step, the advection and
propagation field.
upon the first sub-iteration, these fields are given by
C and the velocity field in the previous time step. At subsequent
iterations, the results of the previous sub-iteration is used to
update the advection and propagation field.
The non-linearities can be taken into account through this technique.
