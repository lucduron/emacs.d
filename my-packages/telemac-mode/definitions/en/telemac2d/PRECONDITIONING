HELP = Choice of the preconditioning in the propagation step linear
system that the convergence is speeded up when it is being solved.
0: no preconditioning
2: diagonal preconditioning
3: diagonal preconditioning with the condensed matrix
7: Crout's preconditioning per element or segment
11: Gauss-Seidel's preconditioning per element or segment
Some operations (either 2 or 3 diagonal preconditioning) can be
performed concurrently with the others.
Only prime numbers are therefore kept to denote the preconditioning
operations. When several of them are to be performed concurrently,
the product of relevant options shall be made.
