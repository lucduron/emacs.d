HELP = Sets the value of the Coriolis force coefficient, in cartesian
coordinates.
This coefficient, denoted FCOR in the code, should be equal to
2 w sin(l)d  where w denotes the earth angular speed of rotation
and l the latitude. w = 7.27 10-5 rad/sec
The Coriolis force components are then:
FU =  FCOR x V,
FV = -FCOR x U
In spherical coordinates, the latitudes are known

DEFAULT = 0.
