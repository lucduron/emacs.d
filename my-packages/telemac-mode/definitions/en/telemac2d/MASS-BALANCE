HELP = Determines whether a check of the mass-balance over
the domain is mader or not.
This procedures computes the following at each time step:
the domain inflows and outflows,
the overall flow across all the boundaries,
the relative error in the mass for that time step.
The relative error in the mass over the whole computation can be found
at the end of the listing.

DEFAULT = NO
